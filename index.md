Hi, my name is Thiago, and I'm a Brazilian computer scientist interested in many aspects of software engineering.
Nowadays, I work as a backend software developer with Ruby on Rails and occasionally use React for frontend development.
I've also worked with Elixir on a small project using the Phoenix framework, and I love exploring the functional programming paradigm.
I'm very interested in deepening my knowledge of various programming languages, which is one of the main motivations for starting this blog.
I hope this journey is as rewarding for you as it is for me.
Thank you for your attention, and I appreciate your time reading my writing.
