## The First
I've postponed the moment of starting to write for far too long.
For quite some time, I kept asking myself when I would finally start publishing about what I've been studying in the field of technology.
Well, the time has come.

The goal here is to write to learn and share. And if this content proves useful to someone, fantastic! Even better.
This is just an initial article to get things rolling. Hopefully, from this first step, many others will follow.
Unlocking creativity for something simple.

The biggest hurdle is the fear of putting myself out there. But at this point, there's no way I'm letting that fear win anymore.

I'll be covering topics related to software development, such as:

Software architecture and engineering.
Algorithms, data structures, and programming logic.
System design.
Exploring programming languages.
Exploring web development frameworks.
Principles of writing good code.
Testing.
Career development.
Design patterns.
Challenges.
Self-organization as a developer (productivity).
There are plenty of topics to explore. Over time, new ideas will come up, and I'll be able to dive deeper into each one.

One thing I intend to do here is avoid making my articles feel "final" or "definitive." I'll write and do my best, but if I find it necessary, I'll update them in the future. To keep track of changes, I'll maintain an update log at the beginning of each article.
No article will be exempt from future revisions.

Currently, my main tech stack is Ruby on Rails, so Ruby and Rails topics will likely appear frequently here. However, the goal is to expand beyond that. I'm already looking into other languages, and I plan to gradually explore what each has to offer.

Let's move forward!
